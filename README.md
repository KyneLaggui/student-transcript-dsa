## üìÑ Description

The Student Transcript Generation System is a command-line-based final project developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It allows users to generate a CSV transcript file for students by providing options such as viewing student details, course-based transcripts (major/minor), overall statistics, and previously generated transcript records. The menu-driven system helps streamline academic data management and improves usability for faculty or administrative use.
